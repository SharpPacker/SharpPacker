SharpPacker
===========

Started as clone of BoxPacker [php library](https://github.com/dvdoug/BoxPacker) (writen by Doug Wright).

Created with additional abstract layer and basic CLI example of library usage.

Additional functionality:

* Pallet packer. How many equal items can be stored in one pallet?

Original description

--------------------
An implementation of the "4D" bin packing/knapsack problem i.e. given a list of items, how many boxes do you need to fit
them all in taking into account physical dimensions and weights.

Especially useful for e.g. e-commerce contexts when you need to know box size/weight to calculate shipping costs, or
even just want to know the right number of labels to print.
